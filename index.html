            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
            <h1>DAVE ANDREWS</h1>
            <p>Getting in shape should be something you enjoy! Itâ€™s an amazing and empowering lifestyle change that
                anyone can achieve. I believe in finding the fun side of fitness.

                <br>

                I grew up in the small town of Southgate, Michigan where I learned that everything tastes better if it's
                deep fried and dipped in ranch dressing. Shockingly enough, that made me gain weight so I decided to
                start working out. The struggle... was... real...
                <br>


                For so long I was afraid to fail. So I gave up. Time and time again. I would work out a bit here and
                there, change my diet a bit, but ultimately end up going back to my old habits. I'm here to tell you
                that you CAN do it. You CAN change your body and habits.

                <br>
                15 years ago I made a change and commitment that has lasted. Now I will help you do the same. Through
                humor and science-backed work out programs, I will help you achieve your goals, whatever they may be,
                with an approach that will work for you.
